# Project Reflection

## problem 1

  The worst thing I had to deal with was the cannot read ___ of undefined. When reaching the end I
  had to make and edge check for both players and ai so the game could continue, otherwise it would freeze on the ai's turn.
  This was espesially hard because i would change one thing and it would throw the error in a different spot.
  
## Problem 2
  
  The second problem I encountered was making my title screen. I first tried making two different files. One for the game and the other for the title.
  This was alot harder than it seemed making me have to change how I implemented it. I instead had to use a variable to change the state of the game all in one big file.
  
## Problem 3

  The aligning of the Title screen text was so difficult because my 0,0 coordinates change after you press 1 or 2 to start the game. So i had to 
  align it when it first loaded and then make a new if statment for after you go back to the menu. The same thing happened for the rules but i never figured out how to fix that on.
  
## Completion

  I was able to get everything done in my "needs to have" but only had enough time to add the rule book and make it look slightly better thn a blank white 
  Screen that says "Checkers" on it. In hind sight I probably should have used the state variable and not tried the other files because I don't know 
  how it works and it  would have saved me alot of time for more pollishing.
